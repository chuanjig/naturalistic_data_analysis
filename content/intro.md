# Neuroimaging Analysis Methods For Naturalistic Data
Naturalistic stimuli, such as films or stories, are growing in popularity for human neuroimaging experiments. More controlled than resting-state data, and more engaging and ecologically valid than traditional tasks, these rich, dynamic paradigms yield data that can be analyzed in many different ways to answer a variety of scientific questions. However, unlike resting-state and task-based designs, there are currently no standard methods to analyze data from naturalistic experiments. While traditional methods (e.g., univariate GLM and functional connectivity) can be used, naturalistic designs open up the possibility for new opportunities for methodological innovation that can take advantage of the unique features of these data. By addressing this topic as an educational course, we can bring together a group of speakers at the forefront of methods development for naturalistic data, who will expose participants to both the breadth and depth of analyses, and provide hands-on experience with cutting-edge open source tools. Our speakers are experts in a variety of analytic methods and have developed several open source tools to aid in analyses that will be featured in the hands on analysis demonstrations. 

# GOALS
- Introduce innovative methods for analyzing naturalistic data to gain insights beyond what is possible with resting-state or traditional task-based designs, including both the theory behind these methods and the details of how they are implemented.
- Provide hands-on experience with cutting-edge tools for performing naturalistic data analysis via tutorials using Python-based jupyter notebooks.
