This course provides a broad overview of the basic concepts needed to conduct neuroimaging data analysis. There is a large amount of base knowledge from different disciplines needed to be an expert in neuroimaging including physics, engineering, statistics, psychology, neuroscience, and computer science. We provide basic introductions to many of the fundamental concepts such as signal measurement, programming in Python, signal processing, data preprocessing, and statistics. We have done our best to incorporate excellent open source content generated by the broader community. Please let us know if we have inadvertently admitted credit for any content generated by others.
