    "# Introduction to JupyterHub\n",
    "*Written by Jeremy Huckins & Luke Chang*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will primarily be using python to learn about fMRI data analysis. Many of the laboratories can be run on your own individual laptops once you have installed Python (preferably via an [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). Often we will also be working with neuroimaging datasets, which can have large storage requirements. We will also occasionally be using additional software that will be called by Python (e.g., preprocessing). Finally, some of the analyses we will run can be very computationally expensive and may exceed the capabilities of your laptop.  To meet these needs, Dartmouth's Research Computing has generously provided a dedicated server on their high performance computing system that will allow us to store data, access specialized software, and run analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main portal to access this resource will be through the Jupyterhub interface. This allows you to remotely login in to the server through your browser at https://jupyter.dartmouth.edu using your netid. Please let us know if you are having difficulty logging in as this might mean we need to have an account created for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of quick notes. You will be sharing this server with your fellow classmates as well as a few other classes on campus. This server has a limited number of resources (currently 16 CPUs and 128gb of RAM). This means that we may not all be able to run our analyses at the same time or the server may slow down or possibly even crash.  To be a good user, please do not leave your notebook running when you aren't using it. This can be accomplished by using the *logout* button when you're done rather than simply closing your laptop or browser. "

Then, if you need to make a change, you can go back and make your edit and rerun the program again, all in the same window. In our specific case, we are going to use JupyterHub which lets several people access the same computer and data at the same time through a web browser. \n",
