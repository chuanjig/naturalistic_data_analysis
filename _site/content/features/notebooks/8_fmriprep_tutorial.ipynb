    "In labs [6](6_Nipype_Quickstart.ipynb) & [7](7_Nipype_Preprocessing.ipynb), we learned about how [nipype](https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) can provide a useful tool to build preprocessing pipelines in python. This provides a completely flexible way to create custom pipelines using any type of software. However, as you already may have noticed, there is a fairly steep learning curve to mastering these concepts and software. In addition, this requires thinking in depth about how you want to setup your processing pipeline and making detailed choices about the parameters for each step. In general, we think these concepts are very important to understand when performing fMRI data analysis, especially when you have messy data that might require adjusting the preprocessing steps or parameters. In practice, most researchers typically use similar preprocessing steps and do not need to tweak the pipelines very often. In addition, many researchers do not fully understand how each preprocessing step will impact their results and would prefer if somebody else picked suitable defaults based on current best practices in the literature.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To meet this need, a team of developers from the [Center for Reproducible Research](http://reproducibility.stanford.edu/) led by Russ Poldrack and Chris Gorgolewski created an easy to use automated preprocessing pipeline called [fmriprep](https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n",
    "\n",
    "fmriprep is a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data preprocessing pipeline that is designed to provide an easily accessible, state-of-the-art interface that is robust to variations in scan acquisition protocols and that requires minimal user input, while providing easily interpretable and comprehensive error and output reporting. It performs basic processing steps (coregistration, normalization, unwarping, noise component extraction, segmentation, skullstripping etc.) providing outputs that can be easily submitted to a variety of group level analyses, including task-based or resting-state fMRI, graph theory measures, surface or volume-based statistics, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, fmriprep performs *minimal preprocessing*. Here we define *minimal preprocessing* as motion correction, field unwarping, normalization, bias field correction, and brain extraction. See the workflows_ for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fmriprep pipeline uses a combination of tools from well-known software packages, including FSL_, ANTs_, FreeSurfer_ and AFNI_. This pipeline was designed to provide the best software implementation for each state of preprocessing, and will be updated as newer and better neuroimaging software become available.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool allows you to easily do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Take fMRI data from raw to fully preprocessed form.\n",
    "- Implement tools from different software packages.\n",
    "- Achieve optimal data processing quality by using the best tools available.\n",
    "- Generate preprocessing quality reports, with which the user can easily identify outliers.\n",
    "- Receive verbose output concerning the stage of preprocessing for each subject, including meaningful errors.\n",
    "- Automate and parallelize processing steps, which provides a significant speed-up from typical linear, manual processing.\n",
    "- More information and documentation can be found at https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/\n",

    "In order to make an automated preprocessing system, it is necessary to have some standards in how the data is organized and named. Historically, this has been a nightmare, where each lab uses their own idiosyncratic conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, there has been increasing momentum in the neuroimaging community to create a consisten file organization system. This specification is called **BIDS** for [Brain Imaging Dataset Specification](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can imagine, individuals have idiosyncratic ways of maintaining files. Think about how you keep track of your files on your personal laptop (versus how your friend does). This may be okay in the personal realm, but in science, it's best if anyone—including yourself 6 months from now—can follow your work and know *which* files mean *what* by their titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of non-Bids versus BIDS dataset found in [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201644):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![file_tree](../../images/fmriprep/file_tree.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Few major differences between above datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In BIDS, files are in nifti format (not dicoms).\n",
    "2. In BIDS, scans are broken up into separate folders by type of scan(functional versus anatomical versus diffusion weighted) for each subject.\n",
    "3. In BIDS, JSON files are included that contain descriptive information about the scans (e.g., acquisition parameters)\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only can using this specification be useful within labs to have a set way of structuring data, but it can also be useful when collaborating across labs, developing and utilizing software, and publishing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, because this is a consistent format, it is possible to have a python package to make it easy to query a dataset. We recommend using [pybids](https://github.com/bids-standard/pybids)."

    "In general, we recommend using this pipeline if you want a sensible default. Considerable thought has gone into selecting reasonable default parameters and selecting preprocessing steps based on best practices in the field (as determined by the developers). This is not necessarily the case for any of the default settings in any of the more conventional software packages (e.g., spm, fsl, afni, etc). \n",

    "However, there is an important tradeoff in using this tool. On the one hand, it's nice in that it is incredibly straightforward to use (one line of code!), has excellent documentation, and is actively being developed to fix bugs and improve the overall functionality. There is also a growing user base to ask questions.  [Neurostars](https://neurostars.org/) is an excellent form to post questions and learn from others. On the other hand, fmriprep, is unfortunately in its current state not easily customizable. If you disagree with the developers about the order or specific preprocessing steps, it is very difficult to modify. Future versions will hopefully be more modular and easier to make custom pipelines.  If you need this type of customizability we strongly recommend using nipype over fmriprep."
