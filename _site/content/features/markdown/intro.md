# COURSE DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES
How can we understand how the brain works? This course provides an introduction to in vivo neuroimaging in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The goal of the class is to introduce: (1) how the scanner generates data, (2) how psychological states can be probed in the scanner, and (3) how this data can be processed and analyzed. Students will be expected to collect and analyze brain imaging data using the opensource Python programming language. We will be using several packages such as numpy, matplotlib, nibabel, nilearn, fmriprep, and nltools. This course will be useful for students working in neuroimaging labs, completing a neuroimaging thesis, or interested in pursuing graduate training in fields related to cognitive neuroscience.

# GOALS
 1) Learn the basics of fMRI signals
 2) Introduce standard data preprocessing techniques
 3) Introduce the general linear model
 4) Introduce advanced analysis techniques

# Labs
This course is designed primarily around learning the basics of fMRI data analysis through interactive jupyter notebooks.

This course covers a lot of ground from introducing the Python programming language, to signal processing, to working with opensource packages from the Python Scientific Computing community.
We will not be covering everything and supplementing your learning via links to short videos, other readings, and more in depth tutorials and resources will be essential to mastering these topics.
