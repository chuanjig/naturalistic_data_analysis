# DartBrains
This repository is a Python package with all of the functions and python libraries required for the Dartmouth fMRI Analysis Course taught by Prof Luke Chang, PhD.

# Contributing
One of the wonderful aspects of both the neuroimaging and Python scientific computing communities is the strong commitment to developing and sharing knowledge and tools within the broader community. The goal of the dartbrains project is to build on this work and provide a resource for people to learn about how to analyze neuroimaging data. We try to incorporate as much open content as we can find that contributes to this goal. Please let us know if we have inadvertently ommitted credit for any content generated by others. Though this project is based on a neuroimaging analysis course taught at Dartmouth College, we welcome contributions from anyone in the broader imaging community.

## Getting Started
The DartBrains project is hosted on [github](https://github.com/ljchang/dartbrains). If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please open an issue.

If you notice any mistakes or have idea for new content, please either open an issue or submit a pull request for us to review.

The website is built using [jupyter book](https://jupyter.org/jupyter-book/intro.html), which creates a jekyll website from markdown and jupyter notebooks. Please read their materials to learn more about this neat resource.
