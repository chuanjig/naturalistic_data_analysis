<p>In our work, we perform standard realignment and spatial normalization. We also perform basic denosing by removing global and multivariate spikes, average CSF activity, linear/quadratic trends, and 24 motion covariates (e.g., 6 centered realignment, their squares, derivative, and squared derivatives).</p>
